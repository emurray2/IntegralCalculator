# IntegralCalculator
This is a JavaScript program that I made to help me calculate Integrals for Calculus I

Setting Up The Project
1. Clone this repository or download all of the files
2. Check to make sure you have all three files
3. Make sure all of the files are in one folder
4. Right click the index.html file and select the option where you can open it with your web browser

How To Use (After Setting Up The Project):
1. When the first prompt comes up, enter the function that you want to calculate the integral of. 
NOTE: You need to enter this function in a way that Java can understand it, or else you will get an error.
Example: To calculate 2x you could type 2*x
More Complex Operations: Java uses certain methods to do certain mathematical operations such as Math.pow(), Math.E(), Math.cos(), etc.
Use these operators to express more complex functions.
You can find the different math methods that Java uses here: http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/20
2. When the second prompt comes up, enter the first bound (a) NUMBERS ONLY! ex: 1,2,3... 28.789 etc. decimal is ok
3. When the third prompt comes up, enter the second bound (b) NUMBERS ONLY! ex: 1,2,3... 28.789 etc. decimal is ok
4. Wait for the text "Your Integral Is: " To appear on the screen

Other Notes:
If you get 0 as an answer and weren't expecting it, double check that you have typed everything in correctly and followed the steps.
Otherwise, you should get an error message if you entered in something wrong.

This program is still fresh off the debugger, so it is not at its best yet. New updates coming soon.
